This table identifies with asterisks (*) the proposals that are primed to be added exclusively to the next release (ual 1.4). These include the core typed stacks system, error stack mechanism, conditional compilation, macros, and the syntax refinements that have been recommended for earlier inclusion. The basic testing framework (part 1) is also marked for potential inclusion in 1.4 due to its utility, though at a medium priority level.
