## Metrics Explanation

- **Clarity**: How clearly concepts are explained and how easy the document is to understand
- **Completeness**: How thoroughly the document covers its intended topic
- **Structure**: How well-organized the document is, with logical flow and sections
- **Examples**: Quality and quantity of code examples and illustrations
- **Consistency**: How consistent the document is in terminology, style, and approach
- **Technical Depth**: How deeply technical concepts are explored and explained
- **Accessibility**: How accessible the document is to readers with varying levels of expertise

## Key Observations

- The highest-rated document overall is the consolidated grammar specification (9.0)
- The ownership system, hashed stack perspectives, and crosstacks proposals score exceptionally well
- The philosophical "To Stack or Not to Stack" document has the highest clarity rating (9.5)
- Technical depth is generally strong across most documents (especially in later proposals)
- Accessibility is consistently the lowest-rated metric across most documents
- Code examples vary in quality, with the macros proposal having the best examples (9.1)
- The first conditional compilation proposal is rated lowest overall (7.9)
