# Evolution of ual: From 1.1 to 1.3

Looking at the original TODO 1.1 list compared to the current state after ual 1.3, we can see significant progress in the language's development, particularly in stack manipulation capabilities and syntax improvements.

## Fully Addressed Items (8/20)

1. ✅ **Multiple stacks** - Evolved from a basic concept to fully implemented first-class objects with `Stack.new()` and predefined stacks.

2. ✅ **Extended stack operations** - Comprehensive stack operations now available, including `over()`, `rot()`, `pick()`, `roll()` and many more.

3. ✅ **Error handling mechanisms** - Implemented through the `.consider` construct with `if_ok`/`if_err` branches.

4. ✅ **Structured "switch" statements** - Added as `switch_case` with multi-value cases and fall-through behavior.

5. ✅ **Stacked mode syntax** - New concise syntax with the `>` prefix and `@stack >` selection.

6. ✅ **Documentation of stack effects** - Integrated into the language specification with clear notation.

7. ✅ **Push/pop between stacks** - Fully supported through the stack object methods and cross-stack operations.

8. ✅ **Standardized stack manipulation terminology** - Aligned with Forth tradition but with consistent object-oriented syntax.

## Partially Addressed Items (2/20)

1. ⚠️ **Standard library expansion** - Some improvements, but still needs further development for embedded tasks.

2. ⚠️ **String manipulation operations** - Basic operations exist but could benefit from further expansion.

## Still Needed Items (10/20)

1. ❌ **Debugging facilities** - Tools for inspecting stack state and tracing execution.

2. ❌ **Fixed-point/floating-point arithmetic** - Support for non-integer calculations.

3. ❌ **Inline assembly** - For hardware-specific optimizations.

4. ❌ **Conditional compilation** - For cross-platform development (targeted by 1.4 macros).

5. ❌ **Binary inclusion facilities** - For embedded resources like images and fonts.

6. ❌ **Interrupt handling** - Critical for embedded applications.

7. ❌ **Optional type annotations** - For improved error checking.

8. ❌ **Compiler optimization hints** - For performance-critical code.

9. ❌ **Memory usage annotations** - For resource-constrained environments.

10. ❌ **Configurable compilation targets** - For platform-specific builds.

## New Priorities Emerging from Evolution

1. **Macro system** - Proposed for 1.4 to address conditional compilation and code generation.

2. **Standard stack patterns library** - Common stack manipulation patterns as reusable components.

3. **Stack verification** - Runtime or compile-time verification of stack operations.

4. **Integration with hardware description** - For FPGA or chip development.

## Overall Progress

The language has evolved significantly from 1.1 to 1.3, addressing approximately 40% of the original wish list. The focus has clearly been on improving the core stack-based programming model, with first-class stacks and stacked mode syntax representing a substantial enhancement to usability and expressiveness.

The areas still needing attention primarily relate to hardware-specific features (interrupts, inline assembly), cross-platform development (conditional compilation), and debugging/testing infrastructure. Many of these remaining items would be addressed by the proposed macro system in 1.4.

The evolution shows a thoughtful, incremental approach that has maintained the language's focus on embedded systems while steadily improving its expressiveness and developer experience.
