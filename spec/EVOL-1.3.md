# Evolution of ual: From 1.1 to 1.3

Looking at the original TODO 1.1 list compared to the current state after ual 1.3, we can see significant progress in the language's development, particularly in stack manipulation capabilities and syntax improvements.

## Fully Addressed Items (8/20)

1. ✅ **Multiple stacks** - Evolved from a basic concept to fully implemented first-class objects with `Stack.new()` and predefined stacks (`dstack` and `rstack`), allowing for unlimited custom stacks with consistent interfaces.

2. ✅ **Extended stack operations** - Comprehensive stack operations now available, including `over()`, `rot()`, `nrot()`, `pick()`, `roll()`, `dup2()`, `drop2()`, `swap2()`, `over2()` and many more.

3. ✅ **Error handling mechanisms** - Implemented through the `.consider` construct with `if_ok`/`if_err` branches, providing a Rust-like approach that avoids exception overhead.

4. ✅ **Structured "switch" statements** - Added as `switch_case` with multi-value cases and fall-through behavior, optimized for different value types.

5. ✅ **Stacked mode syntax** - New concise syntax with the `>` prefix and `@stack >` selection, bridging stack-based and traditional programming styles.

6. ✅ **Documentation of stack effects** - Integrated into the language specification with clear notation for stack manipulation operations.

7. ✅ **Push/pop between stacks** - Fully supported through the stack object methods and cross-stack operations, enabling flexible data flow between different stacks.

8. ✅ **Standardized stack manipulation terminology** - Aligned with Forth tradition but with consistent object-oriented syntax through stack methods.

## Partially Addressed Items (2/20)

1. ⚠️ **Standard library expansion** - Some improvements to the standard library, but still needs further development for common embedded tasks.

2. ⚠️ **String manipulation operations** - Basic operations exist in the `str` package but could benefit from further expansion beyond `Index`, `Split`, and `Join`.

## Still Needed Items (10/20)

1. ❌ **Debugging facilities** - Tools for inspecting stack state and tracing execution, especially important with multiple stack objects.

2. ❌ **Fixed-point/floating-point arithmetic** - Support for non-integer calculations needed for many applications.

3. ❌ **Inline assembly** - For hardware-specific optimizations in performance-critical code.

4. ❌ **Conditional compilation** - For cross-platform development (targeted by 1.4 macro system proposal).

5. ❌ **Binary inclusion facilities** - For embedded resources like images, fonts, and other assets.

6. ❌ **Interrupt handling** - Critical for many embedded applications that need to respond to hardware events.

7. ❌ **Optional type annotations** - For improved error checking while maintaining the language's flexibility.

8. ❌ **Compiler optimization hints** - For performance-critical code sections.

9. ❌ **Memory usage annotations** - For better resource management in constrained environments.

10. ❌ **Configurable compilation targets** - For platform-specific builds across different hardware.

## New Priorities Emerging from Evolution

1. **Macro system** - Proposed for 1.4 to address conditional compilation, code generation, and platform-specific adaptations.

2. **Standard stack patterns library** - Common stack manipulation patterns as reusable components that leverage the new first-class stack objects.

3. **Stack verification** - Runtime or compile-time verification of stack operations, depths, and types.

4. **Integration with hardware description** - For FPGA or custom chip development.

5. **Structured data serialization** - For data storage and communication protocols.

6. **Testing framework** - To improve development experience and code reliability.

## Overall Progress

The language has evolved significantly from 1.1 to 1.3, addressing approximately 40% of the original wish list. The focus has clearly been on improving the core stack-based programming model, with first-class stacks and stacked mode syntax representing a substantial enhancement to usability and expressiveness.

The areas still needing attention primarily relate to hardware-specific features (interrupts, inline assembly), cross-platform development (conditional compilation), and debugging/testing infrastructure. Many of these remaining items would be addressed by the proposed macro system in 1.4, which appears to be a key priority for the next evolution of the language.

The proposed features for 1.4, particularly the macro system and conditional compilation, show a thoughtful roadmap that would address several of the remaining TODO items while maintaining ual's focus on embedded systems programming.

The evolution demonstrates a pragmatic, incremental approach that has maintained the language's focus on embedded systems while steadily improving its expressiveness, flexibility, and developer experience. The transition to first-class stack objects in particular represents a major leap forward in design coherence, unifying the dual paradigm approach through a consistent object-oriented interface.
