# Evolution of ual: From 1.1 to 1.4 (Proposed)

Looking at the original TODO 1.1 list compared to the current state after ual 1.3 and the proposed 1.4 enhancements, we can see significant progress in the language's development, particularly in stack manipulation capabilities, error handling, and syntax improvements.

## Fully Addressed Items (9/20)

1. ✅ **Multiple stacks** - Evolved from a basic concept to fully implemented first-class objects with `Stack.new()` and predefined stacks (`dstack` and `rstack`), allowing for unlimited custom stacks with consistent interfaces.

2. ✅ **Extended stack operations** - Comprehensive stack operations now available, including `over()`, `rot()`, `nrot()`, `pick()`, `roll()`, `dup2()`, `drop2()`, `swap2()`, `over2()` and many more.

3. ✅ **Error handling mechanisms** - Initially implemented through the `.consider` construct with `if_ok`/`if_err` branches, and now significantly enhanced with the proposed `@error` stack system providing compile-time guarantees, unified error handling across paradigms, and zero runtime overhead while maintaining conceptual simplicity.

4. ✅ **Structured "switch" statements** - Added as `switch_case` with multi-value cases and fall-through behavior, optimized for different value types.

5. ✅ **Stacked mode syntax** - New concise syntax with the `>` prefix and `@stack >` selection, bridging stack-based and traditional programming styles.

6. ✅ **Documentation of stack effects** - Integrated into the language specification with clear notation for stack manipulation operations.

7. ✅ **Push/pop between stacks** - Fully supported through the stack object methods and cross-stack operations, enabling flexible data flow between different stacks.

8. ✅ **Standardized stack manipulation terminology** - Aligned with Forth tradition but with consistent object-oriented syntax through stack methods.

9. ✅ **Debugging facilities** - Substantially addressed through the proposed `@error` stack system, which provides clear error propagation paths, compile-time verification, and structured error handling patterns that make code behavior more predictable and traceable.

## Partially Addressed Items (4/20)

1. ⚠️ **Standard library expansion** - Some improvements to the standard library, but still needs further development for common embedded tasks.

2. ⚠️ **String manipulation operations** - Basic operations exist in the `str` package but could benefit from further expansion beyond `Index`, `Split`, and `Join`.

3. ⚠️ **Conditional compilation** - Addressed in the proposed macro system for 1.4, which leverages ual's native syntax rather than introducing a separate preprocessor language.

4. ⚠️ **Configurable compilation targets** - Significantly addressed in the 1.4 conditional compilation proposal through:
   - The `TARGET` compile-time variable to identify platforms
   - Platform-specific code selection via macros
   - Feature toggles through the `FEATURES` table
   - Hardware characteristics detection via `CPU_BITS` and similar variables
   
   What still remains to be addressed:
   - Complete toolchain configuration for diverse targets
   - Target-specific memory maps and hardware abstraction layers
   - Multiple architecture compilation in a single build process

## Still Needed Items (7/20)

1. ❌ **Fixed-point/floating-point arithmetic** - Support for non-integer calculations needed for many applications.

2. ❌ **Inline assembly** - For hardware-specific optimizations in performance-critical code.

3. ❌ **Binary inclusion facilities** - For embedded resources like images, fonts, and other assets.

4. ❌ **Interrupt handling** - Critical for many embedded applications that need to respond to hardware events.

5. ❌ **Optional type annotations** - For improved error checking while maintaining the language's flexibility.

6. ❌ **Compiler optimization hints** - For performance-critical code sections.

7. ❌ **Memory usage annotations** - For better resource management in constrained environments.

## New Priorities Emerging from Evolution

1. **Macro system** - Proposed for 1.4 to address conditional compilation, code generation, and platform-specific adaptations.

2. **Standard stack patterns library** - Common stack manipulation patterns as reusable components that leverage the first-class stack objects, potentially including patterns for the new `@error` stack.

3. **Stack verification** - Runtime or compile-time verification of stack operations, depths, and types, with the `@error` stack proposal already demonstrating the viability of compile-time verification.

4. **Testing framework** - To improve development experience and code reliability, potentially leveraging the `@error` stack for test assertions and validation.

5. **Error categories and conventions** - Building on the `@error` stack proposal, standardized error types and handling patterns for different subsystems and failure modes.

## Overall Progress

The language has evolved significantly from 1.1 to the proposed 1.4, addressing approximately 45% of the original wish list completely and another 20% partially. The focus has clearly been on improving the core stack-based programming model, with first-class stacks, stacked mode syntax, and the proposed `@error` stack system representing substantial enhancements to usability, safety, and expressiveness.

The 1.4 proposals show particular strength in leveraging ual's unique design to solve traditional programming challenges:

1. **Error Handling**: The `@error` stack proposal demonstrates how ual can innovate by extending its core stack paradigm to create elegant, zero-overhead error management rather than borrowing models from other languages.

2. **Conditional Compilation**: The macro system proposal builds on ual's syntax rather than introducing a preprocessor language, maintaining coherence while enabling powerful cross-platform capabilities.

These proposed features strengthen ual's dual-paradigm approach by providing unified mechanisms that work seamlessly in both variable-based and stack-based code. This reinforces ual's position as a uniquely powerful language for embedded systems that provides both the direct control of stack-based programming and the readability of traditional approaches.

The areas still needing attention align perfectly with ual's core purpose as a language for embedded systems:
- Hardware interaction capabilities (interrupts, inline assembly)
- Numeric computing (fixed/floating point) for sensor data processing
- Resource management (memory annotations, binary inclusion) for constrained environments

Many of these remaining items could potentially be addressed or facilitated by the proposed macro system in 1.4 once it's established, furthering ual's goal of providing a high-level language that remains suitable for minimal platforms.

The evolution demonstrates a pragmatic, incremental approach that has maintained the language's focus on embedded systems while steadily improving its expressiveness, safety, flexibility, and developer experience. The progression of features shows a thoughtful design philosophy that values conceptual integrity over mere feature accumulation, staying true to ual's stated goals of:

1. **Stack-based operations** for arithmetic and memory access
2. **Lua-style** control flow, scoping, and data structures
3. **Go-like package** conventions
4. **Multiple returns** and flexible control structures
5. **Binary/Hexadecimal** numeric literals for hardware-oriented programming
6. **Bitwise operators** for direct manipulation of registers and masks

The 1.4 proposals maintain this philosophy while extending the language's capabilities in ways that enhance rather than dilute its focused design.
