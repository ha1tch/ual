# Things ual Needs That Would Be Welcome by Developers

1. **Multiple stacks** - Having separate data and return stacks like in Forth would provide more flexibility for complex algorithms and prevent accidental stack corruption

2. **Extended stack operations** - Additional operations like `over()`, `rot()`, `pick()`, and `roll()` would make complex stack manipulations more elegant

3. **Error handling mechanisms** - The specification doesn't detail how errors are handled, trapped, or reported to the developer

4. **Debugging facilities** - Tools for inspecting the stack state, tracing execution, and debugging programs in constrained environments

5. **Fixed-point or floating-point arithmetic support** - For applications requiring decimal calculations beyond integer math

6. **String manipulation operations** - More comprehensive string handling beyond the basic `str` package functions

7. **Structured data serialization** - Methods to serialize/deserialize tables and arrays for storage or transmission

8. **Inline assembly** - Ability to embed target-specific assembly for performance-critical sections

9. **Conditional compilation** - Preprocessor-like directives to include/exclude code based on target platform

10. **Standard library expansion** - More comprehensive libraries for common embedded tasks like sensor interfacing or communications protocols

11. **Concurrency primitives** - Simple mechanisms for handling concurrent operations on platforms that support it

12. **Documentation annotations** - Ways to document function stack effects and parameter information

13. **Optional type annotations** - For better error checking and potential optimization

14. **Compiler optimization hints** - Ways to guide the compiler on performance-critical sections

15. **Binary inclusion facilities** - Methods to include binary data in compiled output (for sprites, fonts, etc.)

16. **Testing framework** - Simple testing utilities specific to constrained environments

17. **Hot reload capabilities** - For platforms that could support development-time code updates

18. **Memory usage annotations** - Ways to specify and verify memory constraints for functions

19. **Interrupt handling** - Clear mechanisms for defining interrupt service routines

20. **Configurable compilation targets** - Easy ways to specify platform-specific compilation parameters
