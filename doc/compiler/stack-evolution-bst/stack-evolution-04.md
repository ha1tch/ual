# Stack Evolution: Reimagining Binary Search Trees from Pointers to Paths

## Part 4: Bitwise Path Encoding Solutions

### 1. Introduction to Path Encoding

In Part 3, we explored two stack-based implementations that moved beyond traditional pointer-based approaches. While these implementations offered advantages in terms of explicitness and safety, they also introduced new challenges: the hashed perspective approach suffered from potential key collisions, while the stack-centric approach required managing multiple parallel stacks.

In this fourth part, we examine a more refined solution: bitwise path encoding. This approach represents a node's position in the tree through an encoded path from the root, using bit patterns to indicate the sequence of left and right turns needed to reach the node. By combining this path encoding with ual's stack abstractions, we create implementations that are both robust and expressive.

We'll explore two implementations of this approach:

1. **BST with Bitwise Path Encoding in ual (784 lines)**: A refined implementation that addresses the brittleness problem.
2. **BST with Bitwise Path Encoding in C (1,405 lines)**: A parallel implementation in C that illustrates the impact of language features on code complexity.

These implementations represent the culmination of our journey from pointers to paths, showing how reimagining data structures can lead to novel, powerful approaches.

### 2. Understanding Bitwise Path Encoding

Before diving into the implementations, let's understand the core concept of bitwise path encoding.

#### 2.1 The Path Encoding Concept

In a binary tree, any node can be uniquely identified by the path taken from the root to reach it. Each step in this path is either a left turn (0) or a right turn (1). By encoding this sequence of turns as a bit pattern, we create a compact, unique identifier for each node position:

- The root is represented by an empty path (depth 0)
- A node reached by going left from the root has path `0` (binary)
- A node reached by going right from the root has path `1` (binary)
- A node reached by going left, then right from the root has path `01` (binary)
- And so on...

For example, in a tree with the following structure:

```
        50
       /  \
     30    70
    /  \   / \
   20  40 60  80
  /           \
 10            90
```

The nodes would have these path encodings:

- `50`: Empty path (root)
- `30`: `0` (left from root)
- `70`: `1` (right from root)
- `20`: `00` (left, then left)
- `40`: `01` (left, then right)
- `60`: `10` (right, then left)
- `80`: `11` (right, then right)
- `10`: `000` (left, left, left)
- `90`: `111` (right, right, right)

This encoding scheme creates a unique identifier for each possible position in the tree, regardless of whether a node exists at that position. It's similar to the way heap data structures identify positions, but applied to binary search trees.

#### 2.2 Path Representation in Code

In our implementations, paths are represented using two components:

```lua
-- In ual
function encodePath(path_bits, depth)
  return {
    bits = path_bits,  -- The actual path bits
    depth = depth      -- The number of bits that are significant
  }
end
```

```c
// In C
typedef struct {
    uint64_t bits;   // The actual path bits
    uint8_t depth;   // The depth of the node (number of significant bits)
} NodePath;
```

The `bits` field stores the path as a bit pattern, while the `depth` field indicates how many bits are significant (since leading and trailing zeros are ambiguous). This representation can efficiently encode paths up to 64 levels deep using a single 64-bit integer.

#### 2.3 Path Navigation Operations

The path encoding enables elegant navigation operations through simple bit manipulations:

```lua
-- Get the left child path
function leftChildPath(parent_key)
  -- Shift left by 1 (multiply by 2) to add a 0 bit
  new_bits = parent_key.bits << 1
  return encodePath(new_bits, parent_key.depth + 1)
end

-- Get the right child path
function rightChildPath(parent_key)
  -- Shift left by 1 (multiply by 2) and add 1 to add a 1 bit
  new_bits = (parent_key.bits << 1) | 1
  return encodePath(new_bits, parent_key.depth + 1)
end

-- Get the parent path
function parentKey(child_key)
  -- Can't go up from root
  if_true(child_key.depth == 0)
    return nil
  end_if_true
  
  -- Shift right by 1 (divide by 2) to remove the last bit
  new_bits = child_key.bits >> 1
  return encodePath(new_bits, child_key.depth - 1)
end
```

These operations make navigation within the tree remarkably elegant:
- For a left child, shift the parent's bits left and add 0
- For a right child, shift the parent's bits left and add 1
- For a parent, shift the child's bits right to remove the last bit

This approach replaces complex pointer manipulations with simple, predictable bitwise operations.

### 3. BST with Bitwise Path Encoding in ual

Our ual implementation of a BST with bitwise path encoding spans 784 lines of code, combining the path encoding concept with ual's hashed stack perspective to create a robust, efficient tree structure.

#### 3.1 Core Data Structure Design

```lua
function New()
  -- Create the main data stack for values with hashed perspective capability
  @Stack.new(Any, KeyType: Any): alias:"data"
  
  -- Metadata stack
  @Stack.new(Any): alias:"meta"
  
  -- Initialize metadata
  @meta: push({
    root_key = nil,  -- No root initially
    size = 0         -- Empty tree
  })
  
  -- Return the tree structure with references to data stacks
  return {
    data = data,
    meta = meta
  }
end
```

This implementation uses two stacks:
- `data`: A stack with hashed perspective capability for storing node data
- `meta`: A stack for storing tree metadata

The crucial innovation is using path encodings as keys in the hashed perspective, creating a direct mapping between tree positions and their corresponding values.

#### 3.2 Insertion Operation

```lua
function Insert(tree, key, value)
  @tree.meta: peek(0)
  meta = tree.meta.pop()
  
  -- Case: Empty tree
  if_true(meta.root_key == nil)
    -- Create the root node key (0 depth, 0 bits)
    root_path = rootKey()
    
    -- Store the value in the data stack using hashed perspective
    @tree.data: hashed
    @tree.data: push(root_path, {key = key, value = value})
    
    -- Update metadata
    meta.root_key = root_path
    meta.size = 1
    @tree.meta: modify_element(0, meta)
    
    return tree
  end_if_true
  
  -- Non-empty tree: traverse to find the insertion point
  current_path = meta.root_key
  
  while_true(true)
    -- Get the current node
    @tree.data: hashed
    current_node = tree.data.peek(current_path)
    
    -- If key already exists, update value
    if_true(current_node.key == key)
      current_node.value = value
      @tree.data: push(current_path, current_node)
      return tree
    end_if_true
    
    -- According to BST property
    if_true(key < current_node.key)
      -- Go left
      left_path = leftChildPath(current_path)
      
      @tree.data: hashed
      if_true(not tree.data.contains(left_path))
        -- Insert as left child
        @tree.data: push(left_path, {key = key, value = value})
        meta.size = meta.size + 1
        @tree.meta: modify_element(0, meta)
        return tree
      end_if_true
      
      current_path = left_path
    else
      -- Go right
      right_path = rightChildPath(current_path)
      
      @tree.data: hashed
      if_true(not tree.data.contains(right_path))
        -- Insert as right child
        @tree.data: push(right_path, {key = key, value = value})
        meta.size = meta.size + 1
        @tree.meta: modify_element(0, meta)
        return tree
      end_if_true
      
      current_path = right_path
    end_if_true
  end_while_true
end
```

The insertion operation follows the same logical steps as traditional BST insertion, but uses path operations for navigation:
1. For an empty tree, create a root node at the empty path
2. Otherwise, traverse the tree to find the insertion point
3. At each node, compare keys and go left or right accordingly
4. When a suitable position is found, generate its path and insert the new node

This approach maintains the essential structure of BST insertion while replacing pointer manipulations with path operations.

#### 3.3 Lookup Operation

```lua
function Find(tree, key)
  @tree.meta: peek(0)
  meta = tree.meta.pop()
  
  -- Empty tree check
  if_true(meta.root_key == nil)
    return nil
  end_if_true
  
  -- Traverse the tree to find the key
  current_path = meta.root_key
  
  while_true(true)
    -- Get the current node
    @tree.data: hashed
    
    if_true(not tree.data.contains(current_path))
      return nil
    end_if_true
    
    current_node = tree.data.peek(current_path)
    
    -- If key found, return the value
    if_true(current_node.key == key)
      return current_node.value
    end_if_true
    
    -- According to BST property
    if_true(key < current_node.key)
      -- Go left
      current_path = leftChildPath(current_path)
    else
      -- Go right
      current_path = rightChildPath(current_path)
    end_if_true
  end_while_true
end
```

The lookup operation demonstrates the elegant navigation enabled by path encoding:
1. Start at the root path
2. At each node, compare keys and navigate left or right by generating the appropriate child path
3. Continue until the key is found or a leaf is reached

This approach combines the conceptual clarity of traditional BST traversal with the robustness of path-based navigation.

#### 3.4 Helper Functions for Child Access

```lua
function hasNodeAt(tree, path)
  @tree.data: hashed
  return tree.data.contains(path)
end

function getLeftChild(tree, parent_path)
  left_path = leftChildPath(parent_path)
  
  if_true(hasNodeAt(tree, left_path))
    return left_path
  end_if_true
  
  return nil
end

function getRightChild(tree, parent_path)
  right_path = rightChildPath(parent_path)
  
  if_true(hasNodeAt(tree, right_path))
    return right_path
  end_if_true
  
  return nil
end
```

These helper functions encapsulate path generation and existence checking, providing a more intuitive interface for traversing the tree structure. They bridge the gap between the path-based implementation and the conceptual tree model.

#### 3.5 In-Order Traversal

```lua
function Traverse(tree, fn)
  @tree.meta: peek(0)
  meta = tree.meta.pop()
  
  -- Empty tree check
  if_true(meta.root_key == nil)
    return
  end_if_true
  
  -- Iterative in-order traversal
  @Stack.new(Any): alias:"stack"
  @Stack.new(Boolean): alias:"visited"
  
  current_path = meta.root_key
  
  while_true(current_path != nil or stack.depth() > 0)
    -- Reach leftmost node from current
    while_true(current_path != nil)
      @stack: push(current_path)
      @visited: push(false)
      current_path = getLeftChild(tree, current_path)
    end_while_true
    
    -- Process current node
    if_true(stack.depth() > 0)
      current_path = stack.pop()
      is_visited = visited.pop()
      
      if_true(is_visited)
        -- Already visited, move to right child
        current_path = getRightChild(tree, current_path)
      else
        -- First visit, process node and push back with visited flag
        @tree.data: hashed
        node = tree.data.peek(current_path)
        
        fn(node.key, node.value)
        
        @stack: push(current_path)
        @visited: push(true)
        
        current_path = nil
      end_if_true
    else
      break
    end_if_true
  end_while_true
end
```

The traversal algorithm follows the standard in-order approach but uses path operations for navigation:
1. Start at the root and follow left children as far as possible
2. Process the current node
3. Move to the right child
4. Repeat until all nodes are processed

This implementation shows how traditional tree algorithms can be adapted to use path-based navigation without losing their essential structure.

#### 3.6 Path Visualization

To make the path encoding more understandable for debugging, the implementation includes a function to convert path encodings to a human-readable string:

```lua
function pathToString(path_key)
  if_true(path_key.depth == 0)
    return "root"
  end_if_true
  
  path_str = ""
  bits = path_key.bits
  mask = 1 << (path_key.depth - 1)
  
  for i = 1, path_key.depth do
    if_true((bits & mask) != 0)
      path_str = path_str .. "R"
    else
      path_str = path_str .. "L"
    end_if_true
    mask = mask >> 1
  end
  
  return path_str
end
```

This function converts a bit pattern like `101` to a human-readable string like `"RLR"` (right, left, right), making it easier to understand the tree structure during debugging.

#### 3.7 Advantages and Characteristics

The bitwise path encoding implementation in ual offers several key advantages:

1. **Non-Brittle Key Representation**: Unlike the string-based approach in the hashed implementation, the bit pattern representation cannot collide with node keys.

2. **Compact Path Representation**: A 64-bit integer can represent paths up to 64 levels deep, sufficient for even very large trees.

3. **Elegant Navigation Operations**: Child and parent relationships are expressed through simple bitwise operations.

4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The path encoding cleanly separates node identification (path) from node content (key-value pair).

5. **Robustness Against Degenerate Trees**: The path-based approach handles even highly unbalanced trees efficiently.

At 784 lines, this implementation is slightly larger than the hashed approach (650 lines) but more robust, showing how a refined abstraction can address fundamental limitations while maintaining reasonable code size.

### 4. BST with Bitwise Path Encoding in C

To provide a cross-language comparison, we also implemented the bitwise path encoding approach in C. At 1,405 lines, this implementation is substantially larger than its ual counterpart, illustrating the impact of language features on code complexity.

#### 4.1 Core Data Structures

```c
// Node path encoding structure
typedef struct {
    uint64_t bits;   // The actual path bits
    uint8_t depth;   // The depth of the node (number of significant bits)
} NodePath;

// Node structure containing key and value
typedef struct {
    KeyType key;     // Key for the BST (used for ordering)
    ValueType value; // Value associated with the key
} Node;

// Hash table entry
struct HashEntry {
    NodePath path;   // The path as the hash key
    Node node;       // The node data
    bool occupied;   // Whether this entry is occupied
    HashEntry* next; // For handling collisions with chaining
};

// Simple hash table for storing nodes
struct HashTable {
    HashEntry* entries;  // Array of hash entries
    size_t capacity;     // Capacity of the hash table
    size_t size;         // Number of items in the hash table
    float load_factor;   // Threshold for resizing
};

// BST structure
typedef struct {
    HashTable* nodes;    // Hash table mapping paths to nodes
    NodePath root_path;  // Path to the root node
    bool has_root;       // Whether the tree has a root node
    size_t size;         // Number of nodes in the tree
} BST;
```

The C implementation requires multiple structures to represent the tree components:
- `NodePath`: Encodes the path to a node
- `Node`: Contains the key-value pair
- `HashEntry`: Represents an entry in the hash table
- `HashTable`: Manages the association between paths and nodes
- `BST`: The overall tree structure

This demonstrates a key difference between ual and C: in C, we must explicitly create and manage the hash table structure, while in ual, the hashed perspective provides this functionality natively.

#### 4.2 Path Operations

```c
// Create a node path from bits and depth
NodePath create_path(uint64_t bits, uint8_t depth) {
    NodePath path = {bits, depth};
    return path;
}

// Get the root path
NodePath root_path() {
    return create_path(0, 0);
}

// Get the left child path
NodePath left_child_path(NodePath parent) {
    return create_path(parent.bits << 1, parent.depth + 1);
}

// Get the right child path
NodePath right_child_path(NodePath parent) {
    return create_path((parent.bits << 1) | 1, parent.depth + 1);
}

// Get the parent path
NodePath parent_path(NodePath child) {
    if (child.depth == 0) {
        // Root has no parent
        return create_path(0, 0);
    }
    return create_path(child.bits >> 1, child.depth - 1);
}

// Check if two paths are equal
bool paths_equal(NodePath a, NodePath b) {
    return a.bits == b.bits && a.depth == b.depth;
}
```

The path operations in C are structurally similar to their ual counterparts, showing how the core concepts translate well across languages. The main difference is the more explicit type handling in C.

#### 4.3 Custom Hash Table Implementation

A significant portion of the C implementation (over 400 lines) is dedicated to implementing a custom hash table to associate paths with nodes:

```c
// Hash function for NodePath
size_t hash_path(NodePath path, size_t capacity) {
    // Simple hash function for demonstration
    // Combine bits and depth in a way that spreads values across the hash table
    uint64_t hash = path.bits ^ (path.depth << 24);
    return hash % capacity;
}

// Create a new hash table
HashTable* create_hash_table(size_t initial_capacity) {
    HashTable* table = (HashTable*)malloc(sizeof(HashTable));
    if (!table) {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    table->capacity = initial_capacity;
    table->size = 0;
    table->load_factor = 0.75;
    
    // Allocate and initialize entries
    table->entries = (HashEntry*)calloc(initial_capacity, sizeof(HashEntry));
    if (!table->entries) {
        free(table);
        return NULL;
    }
    
    // Initialize all entries as unoccupied
    for (size_t i = 0; i < initial_capacity; i++) {
        table->entries[i].occupied = false;
        table->entries[i].next = NULL;
    }
    
    return table;
}

// Insert a node into the hash table
bool hash_table_insert(HashTable* table, NodePath path, Node node) {
    // Check if resize is needed
    if ((float)table->size / table->capacity >= table->load_factor) {
        if (!resize_hash_table(table, table->capacity * 2)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate hash
    size_t index = hash_path(path, table->capacity);
    
    // If the slot is empty, insert directly
    if (!table->entries[index].occupied) {
        table->entries[index].path = path;
        table->entries[index].node = node;
        table->entries[index].occupied = true;
        table->size++;
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check for existing key, handle collisions, etc.
    // (Abbreviated for brevity)
}
```

This code handles the association between paths and nodes that ual provides automatically through its hashed perspective. The need to implement this functionality manually accounts for a substantial portion of the C implementation's larger size.

#### 4.4 Insertion Operation

```c
bool bst_insert(BST* tree, KeyType key, ValueType value) {
    if (!tree) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Create a node with the given key and value
    Node new_node = {key, value};
    
    // If tree is empty, insert at root
    if (!tree->has_root) {
        if (hash_table_insert(tree->nodes, tree->root_path, new_node)) {
            tree->has_root = true;
            tree->size = 1;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Start at the root
    NodePath current_path = tree->root_path;
    Node current_node;
    
    // Traverse to find insertion point
    while (hash_table_find(tree->nodes, current_path, &current_node)) {
        // If key already exists, update value
        if (key == current_node.key) {
            new_node.key = key;
            new_node.value = value;
            return hash_table_insert(tree->nodes, current_path, new_node);
        }
        
        // Decide whether to go left or right
        if (key < current_node.key) {
            // Try to go left
            NodePath left_path = left_child_path(current_path);
            
            // If no left child, insert here
            if (!hash_table_contains(tree->nodes, left_path)) {
                if (hash_table_insert(tree->nodes, left_path, new_node)) {
                    tree->size++;
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
            
            // Continue down left subtree
            current_path = left_path;
        } else {
            // Try to go right
            NodePath right_path = right_child_path(current_path);
            
            // If no right child, insert here
            if (!hash_table_contains(tree->nodes, right_path)) {
                if (hash_table_insert(tree->nodes, right_path, new_node)) {
                    tree->size++;
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
            
            // Continue down right subtree
            current_path = right_path;
        }
    }
    
    return false;  // Should not reach here
}
```

The insertion logic is similar to the ual version, but with more explicit error handling and memory management. Each hash table operation requires checking for success or failure, adding complexity compared to the ual implementation.

#### 4.5 Key Implementation Challenges in C

The C implementation faces several challenges not present in the ual version:

1. **Manual Memory Management**: Allocating and freeing memory for hash table entries, handling potential allocation failures.

2. **Collision Handling**: Implementing a collision resolution strategy (chaining in this case) for the hash table.

3. **Error Propagation**: Explicitly checking and propagating error states throughout the code.

4. **Type Safety**: Manually ensuring type correctness without the benefit of ual's type checking.

5. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensuring all allocated resources are properly freed, especially in error cases.

These challenges contribute significantly to the increased code size and complexity of the C implementation.

#### 4.6 Traversal Implementation

```c
void bst_traverse(BST* tree, void (*callback)(KeyType key, ValueType value)) {
    if (!tree || !tree->has_root || !callback) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Stack for iterative traversal
    typedef struct {
        NodePath path;
        bool visited;
    } StackEntry;
    
    StackEntry* stack = (StackEntry*)malloc(sizeof(StackEntry) * tree->size);
    if (!stack) {
        return;
    }
    
    int stack_size = 0;
    NodePath current_path = tree->root_path;
    
    // Iterative in-order traversal
    while (current_path.depth > 0 || stack_size > 0) {
        // Reach the leftmost node
        while (current_path.depth > 0 && bst_has_node_at(tree, current_path)) {
            // Push to stack

            // Go left

The traversal implementation in C requires manually managing the traversal stack, checking for allocation failures, and ensuring proper cleanup. This contrasts with ual's more concise stack manipulation, highlighting how ual's first-class stack support simplifies code that works with stack-like structures.

### 5. Comparing the Bitwise Path Implementations

When we compare the ual and C implementations of the bitwise path encoding approach, several interesting differences emerge:

#### 5.1 Code Size Disparities

The substantial difference in code size (784 lines for ual vs. 1,405 lines for C) stems from several factors:

1. **Built-in Hash Map Support**: ual's hashed perspective provides built-in hash map functionality, while the C implementation requires a custom hash table implementation (over 400 lines).

2. **Automatic Memory Management**: ual handles memory management automatically, while C requires explicit allocation, deallocation, and error handling.

3. **Stack Abstraction**: ual's first-class support for stacks simplifies traversal algorithms that rely on stack-like structures.

4. **Error Handling**: C requires explicit error checking and propagation, while ual provides more concise error handling.

These differences highlight how language features can significantly impact implementation complexity, even when the underlying algorithm remains essentially the same.

#### 5.2 Structural Similarities

Despite the size difference, the implementations share striking structural similarities:

1. **Path Representation**: Both use identical bit-pattern encoding for tree paths.

2. **Navigation Operations**: Both implement the same bitwise operations for parent-child navigation.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**: Both follow the same high-level algorithms for insertion, lookup, deletion, and traversal.

4. **BST Property Maintenance**: Both preserve the BST property through the same comparison and navigation logic.

These similarities demonstrate that the core concepts of path encoding translate well across languages, even as implementation details vary significantly.

#### 5.3 Efficiency Considerations

Both implementations offer similar algorithmic efficiency, but with different performance characteristics:

**ual Implementation**:
- Leverages built-in hashed perspective for efficient path-to-node mapping
- Simpler memory management may reduce overhead
- Higher-level abstractions might introduce some performance cost

**C Implementation**:
- Custom hash table allows optimization for specific use case
- Direct memory management enables fine-grained control
- Lower-level code potentially allows more optimization

In practice, the performance difference would likely depend on specific workloads and optimization efforts, with neither approach having an inherent algorithmic advantage.

#### 5.4 Safety vs. Control

The implementations illustrate the classic trade-off between safety and control:

**ual Implementation**:
- Automatic memory management prevents leaks and dangling pointers
- Type checking enhances safety
- Higher-level abstractions reduce error vectors
- More concise code potentially reduces bug surface

**C Implementation**:
- Manual memory management provides precise control
- Explicit error handling forces consideration of failure cases
- Direct pointer manipulation enables low-level optimizations
- Greater verbosity potentially increases bug surface

This trade-off represents one of the fundamental tensions in programming language design, with no universally "better" approach—each has strengths for different contexts and requirements.

### 6. Key Insights from Bitwise Path Encoding

The bitwise path encoding implementations reveal several profound insights about data structures and their representation:

#### 6.1 Explicit vs. Implicit Position

Traditional pointer-based trees implicitly encode node positions through memory references. Path encoding makes positions explicit by directly representing the path to each node. This shift from implicit to explicit position brings both benefits (clarity, safety) and costs (additional state management).

#### 6.2 Unifying Structure and Access

Path encoding unifies structural representation with access patterns—the same path that identifies a node's position also provides the means to reach it. This unification creates a more coherent conceptual model compared to the separation between structure (pointers) and access (traversal) in traditional implementations.

#### 6.3 Memory Density and Locality

The hash table approach with path keys organizes nodes by their logical position in the tree rather than their allocation order. This potentially improves memory locality for operations that follow tree paths, as logically adjacent nodes may be stored closer together in the hash table.

#### 6.4 Navigational Elegance

The bitwise operations for tree navigation (left child, right child, parent) represent a particularly elegant aspect of path encoding. These operations directly express the tree's structural relationships through simple, predictable bit manipulations, replacing pointer dereferencing with more conceptually clear operations.

#### 6.5 Trade-offs in Representation

The path encoding approach trades direct memory references (pointers) for logical position encoding (paths). This trade-off exchanges the efficiency of direct memory access for the safety and clarity of position-based addressing. The implementation complexity difference between ual and C demonstrates how language features can significantly impact this trade-off.

### 7. Conclusion: From Pointers to Paths

The bitwise path encoding implementations represent the culmination of our journey from pointer-based to path-based tree representations. They address the brittleness of the hashed approach and the complexity of parallel stacks while maintaining the explicitness that gives ual its distinctive character.

This approach offers a unique perspective on binary search trees, showing how reimagining a familiar data structure through the lens of paths rather than pointers can lead to implementations with different characteristics and trade-offs. While not necessarily "better" than traditional approaches in all respects, path encoding brings distinctive benefits in clarity, safety, and conceptual coherence.

In the final part of our series, we'll synthesize the insights from all five implementations, exploring when each approach might be most appropriate and what broader lessons we can draw about data structures, programming paradigms, and the nature of software representation.
